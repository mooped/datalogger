CoAP Data Logger
================

A simple data logger that reads a few sensors (internal temperature, Si7007 Temperature and Humidity, CCS811 CO2 and VOC sensor) and sends JSON data to a CoAP server to be timestamped and submitted to a database.

Currently more of a collision of example projects than a real application. Use at your own risk!
